Ingredients: 

225g of pizza dough rolled into a ball


Pre-heat oven to 500ยบ (or as hot as your oven will go) and place pizza steel, pizza stone or an upside-down sheet pan on the middle rack.

1)Place dough ball on a piece of parchment paper on a cutting board. Flatten the dough ball and lightly push most of the air out to the edge of the crust. Maintaining the same thickness (in all but the outer 3/4" of the dough), stretch the dough along the edge until it is thin-crust-pizza-shaped.

3) Spread 2-3 Tbs pesto around the pie being careful to not deflate crust

4) add layer of very thinly sliced whole roasted beets overlapping about 1/4 of each beet slice going around the perimeter in toward the center.

5) Toss a good handful of arugula in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle mixture evenly over the pie

6) Sprinkle feta crumbles on the pie


7) Holding the cutting board, slide the parchment paper onto the steel

8) Bake for 10-12 minutes

9) Remove from oven sliding the parchment paper back onto your cutting board. Immediately drizzle balsamic glaze on the pie.

10) Cut into quarters and enjoy!
